          <p>
            I am a Computer Information Technology student with a focus on databases, web
            development, and systems analysis. I enjoy working on projects where I can talk with
            people, understand what they need, and then build something useful with SQL, PHP, or
            Python. My background in customer service and supervision has taught me to stay calm
            during busy times, solve problems quickly, and communicate clearly with diverse groups
            of people. I am looking for a practicum where I can contribute to real projects, grow
            my technical skills, and be a supportive teammate.

      <div class="card">
  <h3>User Registration &amp; Login System (PHP/MySQL)</h3>
  <p class="muted">PHP · MySQL · Authentication · Form Validation</p>
  <p>
    I built a user registration and login web application using PHP and MySQL. The system
    allows users to sign up with a unique email, stores passwords securely using hashing, and
    validates input on both the client and server side. I planned the database tables,
    designed the forms, wrote the backend logic, and tested various error conditions to make
    sure the experience felt smooth and predictable for the user.
  </p>

    <img src="register-ui.png" alt="Create Account screen from my PHP/MySQL registration system" />
    <figcaption>Create Account screen with username, password, theme selection, and dynamic preview.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Building this project taught me how to organize tasks (design, database, logic, testing),
    anticipate problems like invalid input or SQL injection, and respond with practical
    solutions such as prepared statements. It also reinforced my understanding of session
    handling and basic security practices.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> Web Development, Problem Solving, Planning &amp; Organization</p>
  <p><strong>Reason to include:</strong> Demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete, real-world web feature from scratch.</p>

      <<div class="card" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
  <h3>Data Analysis Script (Python)</h3>
  <p class="muted">Python · CSV Processing · Reporting</p>
  <p>
    To expand my skills beyond web development, I created a Python script that reads data from
    CSV files and generates simple reports. The script cleans the data, calculates summary
    statistics (like totals and averages), and can export the results or print them in a
    readable format. I also experimented with basic charting options to visualize trends.
  </p>

  <pre class="code-block">
import csv

def load_sales(path):
    with open(path, newline="") as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        return [row for row in reader]

rows = load_sales("sales.csv")
total = sum(float(r["amount"]) for r in rows)
average = total / len(rows)

print(f"Total sales: ${total:.2f}")
print(f"Average sale: ${average:.2f}")
  </pre>

  <p>
    This project helped me practice working with files, loops, and functions in Python, and it
    showed me how programming can save time by automating repetitive analysis tasks.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> Analytical Thinking, Self-Directed Learning, Adaptability</p>
